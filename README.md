# Differentiable program for multiverse optimisation

The `hypercoil` repository is the temporary home of this project. The overall objective is development of a connectome pipeline that learns its own parameters subject to a user-specified loss and regularisations, together with a reasonable initialisation.

To attain this objective, the software implements neuroimage processing steps as differentiable PyTorch modules.

Public warning: While numerous components are operational, the repository as a whole is not ready for deployment or use at this time.
