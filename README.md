# Differentiable program for multiverse optimisation

The `hypercoil` (or `hypernova`, or `starcoil`, depending on what version you're looking at) repository is the temporary home of this project. The overall objective is development of a connectome pipeline that learns its own parameters subject to a user-specified loss and regularisations, together with a reasonable initialisation.

To attain this objective, the software implements neuroimage processing steps as differentiable PyTorch modules.
