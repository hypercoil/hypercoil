~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've found this page, it's probably because you followed a link from our OHBM poster. Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to present at OHBM. However, if you're interested in this work, I'd invite you to view `our preprint <https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00649>`_. Additionally, feel free to reach out if you have questions or would like to discuss this further. My contact email is posted on the arXiv and on the first page of the preprint. In the mean time, you are also welcome to star or follow `our GitHub repository <https://github.com/rciric/hypercoil/>`_ to receive updates as we expand our documentation and functionality toward an alpha release.
