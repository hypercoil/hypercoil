Installation
============

PyPI instructions coming soon.

Ensure that your ``torch`` installation has CUDA / cuDNN support if GPU acceleration is desired. Note that ``hypercoil`` currently uses PyTorch as its underlying framework for automatic differentiation and modelling. The development version uses JAX.
