Installation
============

Currently, direct installation from GitHub is recommended. For example::

   python -m pip install https://github.com/rciric/hypercoil/archive/main.tar.gz

or equivalent.

Ensure that your ``torch`` installation has CUDA / cuDNN support if GPU acceleration is desired. Note that ``hypercoil`` uses PyTorch as its underlying framework for automatic differentiation and modelling.
